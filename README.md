# CRZ 🙌(Work In Progress)
- Note: Refer https://github.com/aaaaryaaa/crz-works for the final code
The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Web App is a digital solution developed and optimized to streamline the process of obtaining construction and convertion clearances for coastal land in the Udupi District. This project was undertaken for the Udupi District Deputy Commissioner's Office with a primary focus on enhancing user experience and accessibility, particularly for the elderly population.


## Problem Statement and Solution😎


- Previously, the clearance process was entirely manual, leading to numerous complications and delays, especially affecting older residents who found the traditional methods cumbersome and challenging.
- The CRZ Web App digitalizes the entire clearance process, making it more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly. By transitioning to a web-based platform, we have significantly reduced the time and effort required to obtain necessary approvals, ensuring a smoother and more accessible experience for all users.
